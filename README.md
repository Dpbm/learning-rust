# Learning Rust

This is a repo I had created some time ago to store some code while learning Rust. However, I had stopped doing my "Rust lessons" due to some reasons that neither I know.

But, recently I started a project in rust and there're some others I want to develop with this language. So, this repo is back to life. Here you can find notes and code. 

Feel free to explore it.
